## How it works

- The page uses the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch movie and TV show data.
- The API key is hardcoded in the script (`apiKey` variable). You may replace it with your own API key for production use.
- The page loads trending movies and TV shows by default, and you can search for specific movies or shows using the search bar.
- Upon clicking a movie or show, a modal opens with an embedded player for viewing the content.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS (for styling)
- JavaScript (for functionality and fetching data from TMDb API)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
